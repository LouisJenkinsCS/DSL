Jacc, a yacc-like parser generator for Java           February 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a preliminary release of the jacc parser generator.  See
the file LICENSE for conditions of distribution and use.

This software requires an installation of a Java 2 runtime, such as
the JDK or JRE from java.sun.com.  (I have used jacc with a variety
of different Java versions, from 1.1 to 1.4, and on a variety of
different platforms, but your mileage may vary.)

To install:

  Copy the file jacc.jar to a suitable directory of your machine.

  On Windows:
    Copy the batch file jacc.bat to a directory on your path.
    You should edit this file so that the string %JACC_PATH% is
    replaced with the absolute path of the directory containing
    jacc.jar (or else set the environment variable JACC_PATH to
    point to that directory).

  On Unix:
    Copy the script file jacc to a directory on your path.
    You should edit this file so that the string $JACC_PATH is
    replaced with the absolute path of the directory containing
    jacc.jar (or else set the environment variable JACC_PATH to
    point to that directory).
